# Custom Representations of Inductive Families in Idris2

This is a walkthrough in Idris2 of the paper by Constantine Theocharis' and Edwin Brady's paper [Custom Representations of Inductive Families](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-99751-8_13).

This uses the run-length encoding compression scheme of a vector example from Edwin Brady's paper [Idris 2: Quantitative Type Theory in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00480) to provide concrete examples for the theory provided by the original paper.
